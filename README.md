# Theme Switching in React and Next

## Description
This repository contains two projects built in React and Next.js that demonstrate toggle switching for theme selection.

### React Project
The React project showcases theme switching functionality using React components, React router and ContextAPI. It is helpful for interview preparation where they ask 
you to implement Dark/Light Mode in React. You will learn how to implement theme toggler in a multi page website using Context API and data attribute from scratch.

### Next.js Project
The Next.js project demonstrates theme switching using next-themes and TailwindCSS. NextJS is getting popular and for making web projects you will most likely use NextJS
and TailwindCSS so its a must to learn how to implement theme toggling in Next. We get some powerful features from next-themes which give us default color-scheme but 
you can specify your own styling using data attribute or TailwindCSS.
